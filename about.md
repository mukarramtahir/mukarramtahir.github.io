Hi, I am Mukarram. I am a PhD student in the Department of Materials Science and Engineering at MIT. I am advised by Alfredo Alexander-Katz and sponsored by the United States Department of Energy through the Computational Science Graduate Fellowship. In my research, I use molecular simulations to design nanostructures that behave as artifical membrane proteins. I got my undergraduate degree from Duke University, where in summers, I would travel to China to do research at Shanghai Jiao Tong University.
