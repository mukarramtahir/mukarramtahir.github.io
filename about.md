Hi, I am Mukarram. I am a PhD student in the Department of Materials Science and Engineering at MIT. I am advised by [Alfredo Alexander-Katz](https://dmse.mit.edu/faculty/profile/alexander-katz) and sponsored by the United States Department of Energy through the [Computational Science Graduate Fellowship](https://www.krellinst.org/csgf/). I got my undergraduate degree from Duke University, where in summers, I would travel to China to do research at Shanghai Jiao Tong University. In my current research, I use molecular simulations to design nanostructures that behave as artifical membrane proteins.
